# ThorVG Viewer

ThorVG Viewer is a verification tool for the ThorVG Engine. It facilitates immediate rendering in a web browser using the ThorVG WebAssembly binary, thereby enabling real-time editing of vector elements. The loader operates locally, ensuring that resources are not uploaded to any external servers, thus safeguarding the copyright of the designer's resources.
